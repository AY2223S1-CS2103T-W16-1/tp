### Project: GuestBook

GuestBook is a **desktop app for managing guests in a hotel,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you are a hotel manager who can type fast, GuestBook can get your
guest management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.
This project is based off AddressBook - Level 3.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `DateRange` field.
  * This field represents the start and end date of a guest's stay.
  * 
* **New Feature**: Added `Bill` field.
  * This field represents the total additional charges incurred by a guest during their stay.
  
* **New Feature**: Added `bill` command.
  * Allows the user to cumulatively update the bill of a guest in GuestBook.
  * This command is typically used to charge a guest, such as for room service.
  * This command ensures that the total bill of a guest is not negative and does not exceed the maximum possible value.
  * This feature greatly aids with GuestBook's efficiency, as GuestBook calculates the new value of the total bill
  automatically.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * to be added soon
