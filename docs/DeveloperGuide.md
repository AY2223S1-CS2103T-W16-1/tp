### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `GuestListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/GuestListPanel.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Guest` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `GuestBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a guest).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `GuestBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `GuestBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the guest book data i.e., all `Guest` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGuestBook` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Guest` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Guest>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `GuestBook`, which `Guest` references. This allows `GuestBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Guest` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both guest book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `GuestBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.guest.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation:

* The `add` command takes in 6 compulsory fields (`Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Room Number`, `Date Range` and `Number of Guests`) and 1 optional field (`Request`) and is supported by the `AddCommandParser` that extracts out each of the fields from their respective prefixes.

The following activity diagrams summarizes what happens when a user enters an `add` command.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How to deal with duplicate entries**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reject any entry with a duplicate name that is case-insensitive.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Will have issues with adding people of the same name to GuestBook.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow duplicate entries to be added with no consequences.
    * Pros: Allows for multiple guests of the same full name to be added.
    * Cons: Easy to abuse the command intentionally (to break the program) or unintentionally (accidentally).

Taking into consideration that in small hotels, the chances of getting two guests that have identical full names are
incredibly unlikely, we decided to proceed with Alternative 1.

**Aspect: Excluding rc/ (isRoomClean) in the `add` command**
* As adding the guest will be done during check in, the room should by default be cleaned for the guest to immediately
be able to enter their room. Hence, we chose to remove rc/ as it makes the `add` command unnecessarily longer.

**Aspect: Excluding b/ (Bill) in the `add` command**
* As adding the guest will be done during check in, the guest should not have incurred any bill costs yet. Hence,
we chose to remove b/ as it makes the `add` command unnecessarily longer.

### Edit feature

#### Implementation:
* The `edit` command takes in an INDEX indicating the index of the guests to edit in the current panel (starting from 1) and 8 optional fields (`Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Room Number`, `Date Range`, `Number of Guests`, `Room Clean` and `Request`) and is supported by the `EditCommandParser` that extracts out each of the fields from their respective prefixes.

The following activity diagrams summarizes what happens when a user enters an `edit` command.

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Allowing only specific fields provided to be edited**
* As the edit command is usually used when there is a change or error in the information provided, it makes more sense for the user to be able to change only selected fields.

**Aspect: Excluding b/ (Bill) in the `edit` command**
* As the `bill` command allows us to add and subtract to the bill directly, the edit command is redundant and may cause user error if they were to replace it by accident.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGuestBook`. It extends `GuestBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `guestBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGuestBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current guest book state in its history.
* `VersionedGuestBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous guest book state from its history.
* `VersionedGuestBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone guest book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGuestBook()`, `Model#undoGuestBook()` and `Model#redoGuestBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGuestBook` will be initialized with the initial guest book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single guest book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th guest in the guest book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGuestBook()`, causing the modified state of the guest book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `guestBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted guest book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new guest. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGuestBook()`, causing another modified guest book state to be saved into the `guestBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGuestBook()`, so the guest book state will not be saved into the `guestBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the guest was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGuestBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous guest book state, and restores the guest book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial GuestBook state, then there are no previous GuestBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGuestBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoGuestBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the guest book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `guestBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest guest book state, then there are no undone GuestBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGuestBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the guest book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGuestBook()`, `Model#undoGuestBook()` or `Model#redoGuestBook()`. Thus, the `guestBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGuestBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `guestBookStateList`, all guest book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire guest book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the guest being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 guests without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The response to any use action should become visible within 5 seconds.
5. The number of guests a user enters should not exceed 4.
6. The guests should have a check-out date.
7. The guest cannot stay for a period longer than 1 year.
8. Data should be saved into a JSON file before exiting the program.
9. The project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every two weeks.

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample guests. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a guest

1. Deleting a guest while all guests are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all guests using the `list` command. Multiple guests in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First guest is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted guest shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No guest is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
